            </p class="text">In the wild soft summer darkness<br>
            How many and many a night we two together<br>
            Sat in the park and watched the Hudson<br>
            Wearing her lights like golden spangles<br>
            Glinting on black satin.<br>
            The rail along the curving pathway<br>
            Was low in a happy place to let us cross,<br>
            And down the hill a tree that dripped with bloom<br>
            Sheltered us,<br>
            While your kisses and the flowers,<br>
            Falling, falling,<br>
            Tangled in my hair….<br>
            The frail white stars moved slowly over the sky.<br>
            And now, far off<br>
            In the fragrant darkness<br>
            The tree is tremulous again with bloom<br>
            For June comes back.<br>
            To-night what girl<br>
            Dreamily before her mirror shakes from her hair<br>
            This year’s blossoms, clinging to its coils?</p>
