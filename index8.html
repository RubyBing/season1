            </p class="text">How sweet, when weary, dropping on a bank,<br>
            Turning a look around on things that be!<br>
            E’en feather-headed grasses, spindling rank,<br>
            A trembling to the breeze one loves to see;<br>
            And yellow buttercup, where many a bee<br>
            Comes buzzing to its head and bows it down;<br>
            And the great dragon-fly with gauzy wings,<br>
            In gilded coat of purple, green, or brown,<br>
            That on broad leaves of hazel basking clings,<br>
            Fond of the sunny day:–and other things<br>
            Past counting, please me while thus here I lie.<br>
            But still reflective pains are not forgot:<br>
            Summer sometime shall bless this spot, when I<br>
            Hapt in the cold dark grave, can heed it not.</p>
