                And give us not to think so far away<br>
                As the uncertain harvest; keep us here<br>
                All simply in the springing of the year.<br>
                
                Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,<br>
                Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night;<br>
                And make us happy in the happy bees,<br>
                The swarm dilating round the perfect trees.</p>

                    That suddenly above the bees is heard,<br>
                    The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill,<br>
                    And off a blossom in mid air stands still.<br>
                    
                    For this is love and nothing else is love,<br>
                    The which it is reserved for God above<br>
                    To sanctify to what far ends He will,<br>
                    But which it only needs that we fulfil.</p>
