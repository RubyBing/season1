            </p class="text">Is it not fine to walk in spring,<br>
            When leaves are born, and hear birds sing?<br>
            And when they lose their singing powers,<br>
            In summer, watch the bees at flowers?<br>
            Is it not fine, when summer’s past,<br>
            To have the leaves, no longer fast,<br>
            Biting my heel where’er I go,<br>
            Or dancing lightly on my toe?<br>
            Now winter’s here and rivers freeze;<br>
            As I walk out I see the trees,<br>
            Wherein the pretty squirrels sleep,<br>
            All standing in the snow so deep:<br>
            And every twig, however small,<br>
            Is blossomed white and beautiful.<br>
            Then welcome, winter, with thy power<br>
            To make this tree a big white flower;<br>
            To make this tree a lovely sight,<br>
            With fifty brown arms draped in white,<br>
            While thousands of small fingers show<br>
            In soft white gloves of purest snow.</p>
