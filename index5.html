            </p class="text">In spring time when the leaves are young,<br>
            Clear dewdrops gleam like jewels, hung<br>
            On boughs the fair birds roost among.<br>
            
            When summer comes with sweet unrest,<br>
            Birds weary of their mother’s breast,<br>
            And look abroad and leave the nest.<br>
            
            In autumn ere the waters freeze,<br>
            The swallows fly across the seas: <br>
            If we could fly away with these!<br>
            
            In winter when the birds are gone,<br>
            The sun himself looks starved and wan,<br>
            And starved the snow he shines upon.</p>
