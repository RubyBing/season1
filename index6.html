            I love the fitful gust that shakes<br>
            The casement all the day,<br>
            And from the glossy elm tree takes<br>
            The faded leaves away,<br>
            Twirling them by the window pane<br>
            With thousand others down the lane.<br>
            
            I love to see the shaking twig<br>
            Dance till the shut of eve,<br>
            The sparrow on the cottage rig,<br>
            Whose chirp would make believe<br>
            That Spring was just now flirting by<br>
            In Summer’s lap with flowers to lie.<br></p>

            I love to see the cottage smoke<br>
            Curl upwards through the trees,<br>
            The pigeons nestled round the cote<br>
            On November days like these;<br>
            The cock upon the dunghill crowing,<br>
            The mill sails on the heath a-going.<br>
            
            The feather from the raven’s breast<br>
            Falls on the stubble lea,<br>
            The acorns near the old crow’s nest<br>
            Drop pattering down the tree;<br>
            The grunting pigs, that wait for all,<br>
            Scramble and hurry where they fall.</p>
