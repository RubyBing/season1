            Lord: it is time. The summer was so grand.<br>
            Upon sundials now Thy shadow lay,<br>
            Set free Thy winds and send them o’er the land.<br>
            
            Command to ripen those last fruits of Thine;<br>
            And give them two more southern days of grace<br>
            To reach their perfect fullness, and then chase<br>
            The final sweetness into heavy wine.<br>
            
            Who now is homeless, ne’er will build a home.<br>
            Who now is lonely, long alone will stay,<br>
            Will watch and read and write long letters gray,<br>
            And in the long lanes to and fro will roam<br>
            All restless, as the drifting fall-leaves stray.</p>
