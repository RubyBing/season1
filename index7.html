            <p class="text2">What charms does Nature at the spring put on,<br>
                When hedges unperceived get stain’d in green;<br>
                When even moss, that gathers on the stone,<br>
                Crown’d with its little knobs of flowers is seen;<br>
                And every road and lane, through field and glen,<br>
                Triumphant boasts a garden of its own.<br>
                In spite of nipping sheep, and hungry cow,</p>

                    And where old Winter leaves her splashy slough,<br>
                    The lady-smocks will not disdain to grow;<br>
                    And dandelions like to suns will bloom,<br>
                    Aside some bank or hillock creeping low;–<br>
                    Though each too often meets a hasty doom<br>
                    From trampling clowns, who heed not where they go.</p>
