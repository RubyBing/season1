            </p class="text">With my breath so keen and chilling,<br>
            I have stripped the branches bare;<br>
            And my snow-flakes white are filling,<br>
            Feather-like, the frosty air.<br>
            
            Coming o’er the lofty mountains,<br>
            There I left a robe of white;<br>
            I have locked the sparkling fountains,<br>
            I have chained the river bright.<br>
            
            O’er the quiet valley winging,<br>
            There I left my traces, too;<br>
            Hark! the merry sleigh-bells ringing,<br>
            With their music call on you.<br>
            
            I have come! The school-boy shouting,<br>
            Joyfully brings out his sled;<br>
            He has seen me, nothing doubting,<br>
            As across the fields he sped.<br>
            
            I have come; but shall I find you<br>
            Better than the former year?<br>
            If you’ve cast your faults behind you,<br>
            I shall gladly greet you here.</p>
